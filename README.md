# Iris  flower classification

Here the task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

## workflow :

1. Data Acquisition : The Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset for classification, consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

2. Data Preprocessing : Load the Data: Load the dataset into a data structure such as a Pandas DataFrame. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize relationships between features using plots.

3. Feature analyzing using correlation matrix : Analyze the correlation matrix to select features that are highly correlated with the target variable and less correlated with each other.

4. Splitting the data and Model training : model that are used here:   
Logistic Regression Model  
K-nearest Neighbours Model (KNN)  
Decision Tree Model  

5. Result : Comparing the models performance and selecting the best model.
